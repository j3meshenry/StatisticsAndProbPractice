# V1 OF PROJECT 1 (STILL ADDING ADJUSTMENTS) 

# In this project,  I created a program that finds the mean, deviation, and probability of an input 
# dataset. 

# Task 1: Calculate the yearly mean and Standard Deviation values of sales (2001-2020)
# Plot the results using two bar graphs 


#2z: We would like to calculate the yearly probability of sale price randing from 
# 200k-300k inclusive. This can be accomplished by counting number of houses sold for a 
# price in that range divided by total number of houses sold that year.

std_dev = (sum(squared_devs) / (len(sales) - 1)) ** 0.5 # std dev from lecture 

#After the deviation, it is easy to calculate the variance 
variance = sum(squared_devs) / (n-1) # corrected variable name
